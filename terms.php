 <!--TERM DETAILS-->
<div class="container">

	<h3 class="text-left">Placing an Order</h3>
	<p><strong>Email:</strong> Please send all orders and artwork to customerservice@primaryprinters.com.
	Acknowledgement: Once your order is placed, we will provide you with an order acknowledgement within
	24-48 hours. If an acknowledgement is not received within 24-48 hours, please contact customer service. The
	acknowledgement will confirm all order items and pricing, as well as ship to information. Please note that the
	ship date will only be confirmed once proof and credit have been approved. It is the distributor's
	responsibility to check the acknowledgement and question any discrepancies within 24-48 hours of receipt.
	Once that time has elapsed, the order will be produced based on the information confirmed in the
	acknowledgement.<br /><br />
	<strong>Changes:</strong> All changes to an acknowledgement must be provided in writing via fax or e-mail and a new
	acknowledgement will be provided. If you do not receive a revised acknowledgement within 24 hours please
	contact customer service to ensure the changes were received.</p>
	<hr>

	<h3 class="text-left">Payment Terms</h3>
	<p><strong>Prepayment:</strong> It is our company policy that all orders must be prepaid upon confirmation of order. Art
	proofs will be issued once prepayment has been reviewed. We accept Visa and MasterCard, as well as check
	or wire transfer. Please contact customer service for additional details.</p>

	<h3 class="text-left">Production Time</h3>
	<p>Standard production time will range from 10-15 working days. During peak periods
	production time may increase to 15-20 work days. Please check with customer service prior to placing your
	order if production time is a concern. Your order acknowledgement will state the current production time at
	the time your order is placed. Any discrepancies between the acknowledgement and your PO should be
	reviewed with customer service immediately. Your order will only be scheduled for production once your
	proof and credit have been accepted. Production time starts at that point and shipping time is in addition to
	production time.</p>

<h3 class="text-left">Disclaimers</h3>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> Primary Printers makes every effort to maintain consistency of the products we supply. However, due to circumstances beyond our control, such as discontinued products, we occasionally have to replace our original items with new ones. Product brands are subject to change without notice and these changes are at the discretion of Primary Printers. The replacement items will always provide a comparable or better quality but may reflect some differences in the dimensions, hues and attributes of the item. Changes in these brands from one order to another are not considered an error in production. Samples can be made available upon request.<br />
<strong>Pricing:</strong> Every effort is made to verify accuracy of the pricing in this catalog and maintain pricing. However, Primary Printers reserves the right to change prices without notice.
Logo Placement: Your logo will be placed as per your proof. However, during the printing process, the placement of your logo will move left to right, up and down approximately ¼” – 1”. This is not considered a defect.<br />
<strong>Scuff Marks &amp; Scratches:</strong> Clear plastic cups and glassware are subject to random scuff marks and scratches that occur during the printing and packaging process. These are not considered a defect.
PLA Compostable Plastic Cups: To benefit the environment, these cups are designed to break down under heated conditions within 40-60 days. All of our PLA compostable plastic cups MUST be stored at temperatures below 105° Fahrenheit or they will slowly begin to breakdown. This information is clearly stated on the outside of every case that is shipped. We make certain that these conditions are carefully observed on site but cannot be responsible once the cups leave our dock. Cups that begin to breakdown will appear melted or somewhat discoloured. This is not a defect and we are not responsible for conditions during transport or once they reach the shipping destination.<br />
<strong>Order Cancellation:</strong> Any cancellation to an order that has already been approved is subject to a $62.50(G) cancellation fee in addition to any screens, proofs and product that have already been produced. A re-stocking fee of 25% may apply.<br />
<strong>Order Change:</strong> Any change to an order that has already been approved is subject to a $62.50(G) cancellation fee in addition to any screens, proofs and product that have already been produced. A re-stocking fee of 25% may apply.<br />
<strong>Claims:</strong> Any and all claims MUST be filed within 5 days of receipt of merchandise. Please keep all original packaging. In the case of non-printed product, all inner packaging (plastic sleeves) must remain sealed and in their original boxes.<br />
<strong>Returns:</strong> Must be associated with a claim made within 5 days of receipt of merchandise. A 25% restocking fee may apply. All returns MUST be pre-approved by Primary Printers. In some cases samples of damaged or defective merchandise will be requested. Shipping will be at the sender’s expense. All returns will only be accepted in their original packaging. Stock items that are non-printed must remain sealed in their inner packaging (plastic sleeves) and in their original boxes. Returns will absolutely NOT be accepted after 30 days from date of delivery. Approved returns will be shipped back directly to our facility in Toronto, Ontario, at the sender’s expense. Related expenses include shipping, brokerage and applicable taxes. Primary Printers will not accept any COD or freight collect shipments. They will be returned at the sender’s expense. Please contact customer service for the exact return shipping address. Any shipments sent to any other location will be refused and returned at the sender’s expense.<br />
<strong>Refused Shipments:</strong> Shipments that are refused or returned to Primary Printers without claim and pre-approval will be the responsibility of the distributor. The distributor will be responsible for all shipping and related charges.</p>
